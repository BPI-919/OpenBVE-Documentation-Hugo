Whilst using the NewXParser or Assimp, openBVE supports most Direct.X object file features, other than animations.

The original parser supports a more limited subset of the DirectX .x object format, based upon that generated by the BVE4 Structure Viewer. 

Full support & documentation of the X object format is not yet available from this site, but the following is an overview of the supported templates, unstructured.

- Frame
- FrameRoot
- Mesh
- Vector
- MeshFace
- MeshMaterialList
- Material
- ColorRGBA
- ColorRGB
- TextureFilename
- MeshTextureCoords
- Coords2d
- MeshNormals
- MeshVertexColors
